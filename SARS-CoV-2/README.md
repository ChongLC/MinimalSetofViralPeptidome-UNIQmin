# Minimal set of sequences for SARS-CoV-2

Primary sequences are treasure troves for studies of sequence diversity and viral evolution. The unprecedented surge in viral sequence data poses a major challenge to studies that are alignment-dependent. Towards this, an alignment-independent or -free approach offers an alternative strategy for such studies. UNIQmin offers an alignment-free approach for the study of viral sequence diversity at any given rank of taxonomy lineage. The tool performs an exhaustive search to generate a minimal set for a given sequence dataset of interest and is big data ready. The minimal set is the smallest possible number of distinct sequences required to represent a given peptidome diversity (pool of distinct peptides of a specific length, *k*-mer) exhibited by a dataset of interest, typically retrieved from a public database. This compression is possible through the removal of sequences that do not contribute effectively to the peptidome diversity pool, which is achieved by subjecting the retrieved sequence dataset to two levels of data compression. Firstly, through the removal of identical sequences, resulting in a deduplicated dataset, which is then followed by removal of unique sequences whose entire repertoire of overlapping *k*-mer(s) can be represented by other unique sequences. The utility of UNIQmin was demonstrated for the species *Dengue* virus, genus *Flavivirus*, family *Flaviviridae*, and the superkingdom Viruses (all datasets before the COVID-19 pandemic). 

Herein, we applied UNIQmin to protein sequence data of SARS-CoV-2 and its higher ranks of taxonomic lineages, namely species, genus, and family to evaluate the effective viral sequence diversity at each rank (**Table 1**). For example, A total of 56,340,320 (as of July 2021) protein sequence records of SARS-CoV-2 were retrieved from the GISAID EpiCoV database. Consequently, deduplication of the retrieved sequences for each of the 27 SARS-CoV-2 genome encoded proteins resulted in 1,780,901 unique sequences in total (~3.2% of the retrieved dataset). Subsequently, the removal of unique sequences that did not effectively contribute to the peptidome diversity resulted in a minimal set of 273,851 sequences (~0.5% of the retrieved dataset). This suggests less than ~0.5% of protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 are alone sufficient to represent the inherent peptidome diversity.
